</div>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<div class="section">
  <p>One of the things that makes <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym> so enjoyable
    are the <acronym title="Non-Player Characters">NPCs</acronym> in your party, and how their background and your character's
    relationship with them add so much more depth to your own storyline as
    well as your gaming experience. This mod will add Auren, a joinable <acronym title="Non-Player Character">NPC</acronym>.</p>
  <p><strong><acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym> is rated T for Teen. This mod contains language considered to be <acronym title="Parental Guidance suggested if under 13 years of age">PG-13</acronym> material. It also contains a female/female romance which is considered
    to be <acronym title="Parental Guidance">PG</acronym> material. Please do not play this mod if this type of content offends
    you.</strong></p>
</div>
<h2>Compatibility</h2>
<div class="section">
  <p>This mod is designed to work with Baldur's Gate II: Enhanced Edition or with Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of
    Amn with or without the Throne of Bhaal expansion pack. There are
    currently no known incompatibilities. </p>
</div>
<h2>Installation</h2>
<div class="section">
  <p><strong>Windows</strong><br />
    The Auren Aseph mod is packaged and installed with <acronym title="Weimer Dialogue Utility">WeiDU</acronym> and is
    distributed as a self-extracting archive. To install, simply
    double-click the archive and follow the instructions on screen.</p>
  <p>Alternatively the files can be extracted from the archive
    using <a href="http://www.rarlab.com/">WinRAR</a>.
    If properly extracted, you should have an aurenaseph folder and
    setup-aurenaseph.exe in your <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym> folder. To install, simply double-click setup-aurenaseph.exe and follow
    the instructions on screen.</p>
  <p>Please run setup-aurenaseph.exe in your <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym> folder to
    reinstall, uninstall or otherwise change components.</p>
  <p><strong>Mac OS X</strong><br />
    <em>If the mod was previously installed, uninstall it before
    extracting the new version.</em>The <acronym title="Gibberlings Three">Auren Aseph mod</acronym> is
    packaged and installed with <acronym title="Weimer Dialogue Utility">WeiDU</acronym>.
    To install, simply extract the contents of the mod into your <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym> folder. If
    properly extracted, you should have a aurenaseph folder,
    setup-aurenaseph, and setup-aurenaseph.command in your <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym> folder. To
    install, simply double-click <strong>setup-aurenaseph.command</strong> and follow the instructions on screen.</p>
  <p><strong>Linux</strong><br />
    Download the latest version of <acronym title="Weimer Dialogue Utility">WeiDU</acronym> for
    Linux from <a href="http://www.weidu.org/~thebigg/">weidu.org</a> and extract
    (at least) the <acronym title="Weimer Dialogue Utility">WeiDU</acronym>,
    weinstall and tolower executables in a $PATH directory (E.G. /usr/bin). Following that, open a terminal, cd to your <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym> installation directory, run `tolower' and answer Y to both queries.</p>
  <p>This mod contains audio that requires oggdec on Linux. oggdec is typically installed in most distributions and, if not, is usually part of the vorbis-tools package.</p>
  <p> You can avoid running the second option (linux.ini)
    if you've already ran it once in the same directory. To save time, the
    archive is already tolowered, so there's no need to run the first option
    (lowercasing file names) either if you've extracted only this mod since
    the last time you lower cased file name. If you're unsure, running tolower and choosing both
    options is the safe bet.</p>
  <p> After that, run 'weinstall aurenaseph' from your game installation directory
    to install or uninstall the mod. </p>

<h2>Contents</h2>
<div class="section">
  <p>Auren Aseph is a young and eager fighter from Beregost. She
    was born to a middle class merchant and his wife, and grew up a
    headstrong girl. Her father would tell her stories of adventurers he'd
    run into while on his caravan routes, and Auren became more and more
    interested at the thought of adventuring as she got older. She'd spend
    hours every week at the famous blacksmith Thunderhammer's shop, staring
    at all of the many types of weapons and armor, both magical and
    non-magical. Her desire to explore the world and independent nature was
    quickly noticed when she was thirteen, when the leader of a group of
    adventurers passing through town saw her eavesdropping on their
    conversations at Feldpost's Inn. </p>
  <p> The adventurers took an interest in Auren and stayed in
    Beregost for a few months. The leader encouraged Auren to learn the
    ways of swordplay, and she begged him to teach her all he knew. By the
    age of fourteen, Auren had joined the group and accompanied them on
    their travels. She saw much of Faerun as they did good deeds for other
    towns, explored caves and dungeons, and acquired many types of
    treasure. At the start of her twentieth year, a series of tragedies
    occured that convinced Auren to retire from the world of adventuring.
    She went to Nashkel, hoping to build herself a new life and settle down
    with the large amount of gold she had saved up over the years of
    traveling. She soon heard about the iron crisis and began to notice it
    herself when she saw her old daggers and sword deteriorating. Auren
    usually fought with two swords, one which she had picked up in a
    dungeon during her travels, and another that she had bought in Beregost
    from Thunderhammer, which appeared to be an ordinary sword, but for
    some reason showed no signs of deterioration. She was tempted to look
    into the iron crisis herself, when she realized the pain that
    adventuring had brought her, so she went about her business and ignored
    it. </p>
  <p> Not too long after she heard about the iron crisis, the news
    came that a group of adventurers, lead by a Child of Bhaal, had stopped
    the force behind the iron crisis and had saved the Sword Coast.
    Realizing that she could no longer ignore the call of adventuring,
    Auren packed her things and made her way to the south, to Athkatla, to
    find a group of good-hearted adventurers like herself that would be
    willing to let her fight alongside them. She arrived in Athkatla and
    made her way to the slums, to the Copper Coronet, where she was sure
    she was bound to run into *someone* interesting...</p>
  <p><strong>Biography</strong></p>
  <p>When you ask her about her past, AUREN is silent before
    explaining that she was born in Beregost, not far from your own home.
    The only daughter of a middle class merchant and his wife, Auren threw
    herself into the art of swordplay when she was only fourteen. She is
    barely twenty years old now, but you can somehow tell from the way she
    carries herself that she is an experienced fighter and has seen much of
    Faerun. You wonder exactly where she learned how to fight so well and
    why she has traveled so much at such a young age.</p>
