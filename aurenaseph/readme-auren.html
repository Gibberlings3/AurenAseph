      <p><strong>Enhanced Editions Note</strong><br />
        The Enhanced Editions are actively supported games. Please note that every   patch update will wipe your current mod setup! If in the middle of a   modded game you might want to delay the patch update (if possible) as   even after reinstalling the mods, you might not be able to continue with   your old savegames. Alternatively, copy the whole game's folder into a   new one that can be modded and will stay untouched by game patches. For BG2:EE it is important that you install the mod to the language   version you are playing the game in. Otherwise, the dialogues of the mod   will not show but give error messages. </p>
      <p><strong>Windows</strong><br />
        Auren Aseph for Windows is distributed as a self-extracting   archive and includes a WeiDU installer. To install, simply double-click   the archive and follow the instructions on screen.</p>
      <p>Alternatively, the files can be extracted into your game directory using <a href="http://www.7-zip.org/download.html">7zip</a> or <a href="http://www.rarlab.com/download.htm">WinRAR</a>. When properly extracted, your game directory will contain <strong>setup-aurenaseph.exe</strong> and the folder<strong> aurenaseph</strong>. To install, double-click <strong>setup-aurenaseph.exe</strong> and follow the instructions on screen.</p>
      <p>You can run <strong>setup-aurenaseph.exe</strong> in your game folder to reinstall, uninstall or otherwise change components.</p>
      <p><strong>Mac OS X</strong><br />
        Auren Aseph  for Mac OS X is distributed as a compressed tarball and includes a WeiDU installer.</p>
      <p>First, extract the files from the tarball into your game directory. When properly extracted, your game directory will contain <strong>setup-aurenaseph</strong>, <strong>setup-aurenaseph.command</strong>, and the folder<strong>aurenaseph</strong>. To install, double-click <strong>setup-aurenaseph.command</strong> and follow the instructions on screen.</p>
      <p>You can run <strong>setup-aurenaseph.command</strong> in your game folder to reinstall, uninstall or otherwise change components.</p>
      <p><strong>Linux</strong><br />
        Auren Aseph  for Linux is distributed as a compressed tarball and does not include a WeiDU installer.</p>
      <p>Extract the contents of the mod to the folder of the game you wish to modify.</p>
      <p>Download the latest version of WeiDU for Linux from <a href="https://github.com/WeiDUorg/weidu/releases/latest">WeiDU.org</a> and copy WeiDU and WeInstall to /usr/bin. Following that, open a terminal, cd to your game installation directory, run tolower   and answer Y to both queries. You can avoid running the second option   (linux.ini) if you've already ran it once in the same directory. To save   time, the archive is already tolowered, so there's no need to run the   first option (lowercasing file names) either if you've extracted only   this mod since the last time you lowercased file names. If you're   unsure, running tolower and choosing both options is the safe bet.</p>
      <p>To install, run WeInstall aurenaseph in your game folder. Then run wine BGMain.exe and start playing. </p>
      <p><strong> Note for Complete Uninstallation</strong><br />
        In addition to the methods above for removing individual components, you can completely uninstall the mod using setup-aurenaseph --uninstall at the command line to remove all components without wading through prompts. . </p>

<p>Auren Aseph is a young and eager fighter from Beregost. She      was born to a middle class merchant and his wife, and grew up a      headstrong girl. Her father would tell her stories of adventurers he'd      run into while on his caravan routes, and Auren became more and more      interested at the thought of adventuring as she got older. She'd spend      hours every week at the famous blacksmith Thunderhammer's shop, staring      at all of the many types of weapons and armor, both magical and      non-magical. Her desire to explore the world and independent nature was      quickly noticed when she was thirteen, when the leader of a group of      adventurers passing through town saw her eavesdropping on their      conversations at Feldpost's Inn. </p>
      <p> The adventurers took an interest in Auren and stayed in      Beregost for a few months. The leader encouraged Auren to learn the      ways of swordplay, and she begged him to teach her all he knew. By the      age of fourteen, Auren had joined the group and accompanied them on      their travels. She saw much of Faerun as they did good deeds for other      towns, explored caves and dungeons, and acquired many types of      treasure. At the start of her twentieth year, a series of tragedies      occured that convinced Auren to retire from the world of adventuring.      She went to Nashkel, hoping to build herself a new life and settle down      with the large amount of gold she had saved up over the years of      traveling. She soon heard about the iron crisis and began to notice it      herself when she saw her old daggers and sword deteriorating. Auren      usually fought with two swords, one which she had picked up in a      dungeon during her travels, and another that she had bought in Beregost      from Thunderhammer, which appeared to be an ordinary sword, but for      some reason showed no signs of deterioration. She was tempted to look      into the iron crisis herself, when she realized the pain that      adventuring had brought her, so she went about her business and ignored      it. </p>
      <p> Not too long after she heard about the iron crisis, the news      came that a group of adventurers, lead by a Child of Bhaal, had stopped      the force behind the iron crisis and had saved the Sword Coast.      Realizing that she could no longer ignore the call of adventuring,      Auren packed her things and made her way to the south, to Athkatla, to      find a group of good-hearted adventurers like herself that would be      willing to let her fight alongside them. She arrived in Athkatla and      made her way to the slums, to the Copper Coronet, where she was sure      she was bound to run into *someone* interesting...</p>
      <p><strong>Biography</strong></p>
      <p>When you ask her about her past, AUREN is silent before      explaining that she was born in Beregost, not far from your own home.      The only daughter of a middle class merchant and his wife, Auren threw      herself into the art of swordplay when she was only fourteen. She is      barely twenty years old now, but you can somehow tell from the way she      carries herself that she is an experienced fighter and has seen much of      Faerun. You wonder exactly where she learned how to fight so well and      why she has traveled so much at such a young age.</p>
